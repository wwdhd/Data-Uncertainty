# Data Analysis and Uncertainty Assignment
The code will be first be divided by problem numbers, then will be combined into one. 
The Matlab file is made in .mlx (MATLAB live script) for faster debugging, but uploaded in .m file (non-live script) so it is easier for the readers to obtain and process the data. 

### ParaView File Checklist
- [x] Number 2 (change the color range to x-ray for surface LIC or hot and warm for standard surface post-processing). The used graphics are from Gradient1 and Gradient2.

### MATLAB File Content Checklist
All of the codes are in order.
- [x] Number 3 
- [x] Number 5
- [x] Number 6
- [x] Number 7
